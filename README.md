# Joe's Jamerator

Generates a random musical scenario for jamming! Includes a root chord, progression, style, feel, and tempo.

Also creates dynamic tablature for scales to apply to to the progression. Scales are based on the randomly-generated key.
As of 2018/11/18, the key is assumed to be major, but these are planned to be dynamic to the 'flavor' of the key in
future updates.

Planned features:
    - More user options (choose options OR set to random, choose 3 of scales, etc.)
    - More options, especially scales
    - Better YouTube link; customize YouTube search string
    - Prettify
